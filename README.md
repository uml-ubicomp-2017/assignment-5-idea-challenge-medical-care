###What can be improved
Considering the fact that those exsiting products are all static, we believe a mobile robot will be better. The reason is simple: people need to buy more than one devices if those products can not move around. People may stay at different places at different time, such as at 8 pm they may stay with family in the living room and then move to their bedroom 2 hours later.  </br>
